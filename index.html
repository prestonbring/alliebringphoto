        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr class="divider">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="column">
				<p>Hi! I'm Lexi Kostelecky, a North Dakota-based photographer with a passion for capturing life's special moments. Born and raised in Dickinson, North Dakota, I now find myself in Fargo while I pursue my education at North Dakota State University. As a 21-year-old junior majoring in Photography, I delight in mixing my academic learning with my creative instincts to produce stunning images.<br><br><br><br>
A little about me: I specialize in portraits, couples, weddings, and other fun events. Whether it's the joy of your special day or capturing you at your best, I strive to capture the essence of every moment. Photography isn't just a hobby for me; it’s an art form that helps me connect with and celebrate the beauty around us. I find joy in freezing time and turning fleeting moments into lasting memories.<br><br><br>
My passion for the arts runs deep. I've been dedicated to professional dance for a decade, and I also play several instruments, including the violin, guitar, and piano. I love reading and enjoy painting, always seeking new ways to express my creativity. This journey has led me to my latest chapter: fulfilling my passion for art through photography. I see my work as a form of worship for my Creator ✟, capturing the beauty He has bestowed upon the world.

				<img src="photos/photo3.jpg" alt="Me <3" class="photo" width="40%">
				<br><br>
				<p>Beyond my camera lens, my faith is a cornerstone of my life. I'm a proud Catholic, and you'll often find me at St. Paul's Newman Center just off campus, where I've found a second home. It's my go-to place for reflection, community, and spiritual growth. If you're looking for me and I'm not behind my camera, there's a good chance you'll spot me there along with my many close friends and wonderful fiancé!<br><br><br>
When I'm not studying or shooting photos, I love to immerse myself in the beauty of everyday life. I'm a big believer in the magic of ordinary moments – a walk around campus, a coffee with friends, or a quiet evening at home. These little slices of life often inspire my work and remind me of the beauty that surrounds us every day.<br><br><br>
Why do I do what I do? Because I believe that every person has a unique story to tell, and I feel honored to be able to tell that story through my photographs. My goal is to make every photo session fun, relaxed, and memorable. I want you to feel comfortable and to let your true essence shine through in every shot.<br><br><br><br>
So, whether you're looking for someone to capture your wedding day, a family portrait, or just some beautiful shots of your favorite places, I'm here for you! ♡ Let's create something beautiful together!<br><br>
I'm excited to get to know you and help you capture the moments that matter most. Feel free to reach out, and let's make some magic happen!
